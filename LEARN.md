# 4-Bit Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA) ‚Äì VLSI Design Course Final Project

This project demonstrates the **complete design of a 4-bit Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA)**, implemented across three key abstraction levels of the VLSI design flow: **behavioral (HDL), transistor-level (netlist), and physical layout (MAGIC)**. An additional **FPGA implementation** was also done to validate the HDL design on hardware.

## üìù Key Learning Points

### üìå **1. Behavioral Level ‚Äì Verilog HDL**
- Designed a **4-bit CLA adder** using Verilog HDL, leveraging **generate and propagate signals** for fast carry calculation.
- Hierarchical design separating logic into **generate (G), propagate (P)** and **sum/carry logic**.
- Verified functional correctness through simulation.

### üìå **2. Transistor Level ‚Äì ngspice**
- Converted the gate-level design into **transistor-level netlist** using **static CMOS logic gates** and **TSPC for clocked elements**.
- Applied **TSMC 180nm process parameters** for accurate transistor sizing.
- Simulated with **ngspice** to confirm correct behavior and analyze timing.

### üìå **3. Physical Design ‚Äì MAGIC Layout**
- Created a **full-custom layout** of the 4-bit CLA adder in **MAGIC**.
- Performed **Design Rule Checks (DRC)** to ensure compliance with TSMC 180nm rules.
- Extracted **parasitic netlist** from the layout and verified it through **ngspice post-layout simulation**.

### üìå **4. FPGA Prototyping ‚Äì Vivado**
- The Verilog design was also implemented on an **FPGA** using **Xilinx Vivado** for prototyping and testing.
- This part did not introduce new design elements, but served as a hardware validation of the HDL design.
