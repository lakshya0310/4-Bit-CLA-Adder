# 4-Bit Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA) – VLSI Design Project

This repository contains the **complete design** of a **4-bit Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA)**, developed as a **final project for a VLSI Design course**. The design is implemented across multiple abstraction levels, demonstrating the full **VLSI design flow** from behavioral description to physical layout and hardware validation.
